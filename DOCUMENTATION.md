### Client Commands

| Command         | Description                    | Usage                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `/access_trunk` | Access vehicle trunk inventory | Near evidence vehicle |

## üîÑ Event Flow

1. **Event Initiation**: Law enforcement player starts event with `/startevidence`
2. **Route Selection**: System uses preset route, custom route, or dynamic route
3. **Convoy Spawning**: Evidence vehicle and escort vehicles spawn at start point
4. **Ped Assignment**: AI escorts are spawned and assigned to vehicles
5. **Convoy Movement**: Convoy drives directly to destination with formation maintenance
6. **Vehicle Trunk Filled**: Evidence vehicle trunk is populated with configured loot
7. **Player Interaction**: Players can engage convoy for loot rewards
8. **Event Completion**: Event ends when convoy reaches destination or is destroyed

## üîß Framework Integration

### QBCore Integration

```lua
-- Job checking
local playerJob = Player.PlayerData.job.name

-- Inventory integration (if available)
if exports['qb-inventory'] then
    -- Use QBCore inventory system
end
```

### ESX Integration

```lua
-- Job checking
local playerJob = ESX.GetPlayerData().job.name

-- Inventory integration (if available)
if exports['es_extended'] then
    -- Use ESX inventory system
end
```

### Export Functions

```lua
-- Check event status
local isActive = exports['djonluc_evidence_event']:IsEventActive()
local eventData = exports['djonluc_evidence_event']:GetEventData()

-- Control events
local success = exports['djonluc_evidence_event']:StartEvidenceEvent(source)
exports['djonluc_evidence_event']:EndEvidenceEvent(success)

-- Get event information
local convoyPos = exports['djonluc_evidence_event']:GetConvoyPosition()
local pedsAlive = exports['djonluc_evidence_event']:GetEscortPedsAlive()
```

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Routes

```lua
Config.Routes.new_route = {
    start = vector4(x, y, z, heading),
    destruction = vector4(x, y, z, heading)
}
```

### Custom Vehicle Types

```lua
Config.Vehicles.custom_type = {
    model = "your_vehicle_model",
    count = 1,
    armor = 1500,
    spawn_offset = 0.0,
    spawn_direction = 0.0
}
```

### Custom Ped Types

```lua
Config.Peds.custom_guard = {
    model = "your_ped_model",
    count = 2,
    weapon = "weapon_carbinerifle",
    behavior = "defensive",
    vehicle_assignment = "custom_type"
}
```

## üö® Enhanced Convoy Movement System

### Key Features

- **Primary Movement**: Evidence vehicle drives directly to destination
- **Formation Maintenance**: Escort vehicles maintain relative positions
- **Stuck Vehicle Prevention**: Automatic detection and correction of stuck vehicles
- **Speed Control**: Configurable convoy speed and follow distances
- **Emergency Formation**: Automatic formation adjustment during combat

### Testing

Use `/testmovement` to test the convoy movement system and verify all vehicles are moving correctly.

### Configuration

```lua
Config.ConvoyMovement = {
    speed = 15.0,                    -- Convoy speed in m/s
    follow_distance = 10.0,          -- Distance between vehicles
    formation_maintenance = true,     -- Maintain formation during movement
    emergency_formation = true,       -- Emergency formation adjustments
    max_deviation = 15.0             -- Maximum deviation from formation
}
```

## üöó Enhanced Convoy System

### Convoy Formation

The convoy now spawns in a proper line formation with the evidence vehicle in the center:

- **Evidence Vehicle**: Spawns at the center point (spawn coordinates)
- **Escort Cars**: Spawn to the RIGHT of center with 5.0m spacing
- **Escort SUVs**: Spawn to the LEFT of center with 5.0m spacing
- **Formation**: Vehicles maintain optimal spacing for convoy movement

### Debug Commands

Use these commands to troubleshoot and test the system:

- `/debugspawn` - Comprehensive check of all convoy vehicles and escort peds
- `/testformation` - Analyze convoy formation and vehicle positions
- `/testpedspawn` - Test spawning peds in specific vehicles
- `/testvehicles` - Test vehicle spawning and positioning
- `/testcoords` - Check vehicle coordinates and spawn points

### Vehicle Assignment

Peds are automatically assigned to the correct vehicle types:

- **Escort Cops** ‚Üí Escort Cars (driver seat)
- **Escort SWAT** ‚Üí Escort SUVs (driver seat)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Peds Not Spawning**: Check ped model names and vehicle assignments
2. **Vehicles Not Moving**: Verify route coordinates and vehicle models
3. **Permission Denied**: Check job configuration in `Config.StartJobs`
4. **Framework Not Detected**: Ensure framework is loaded before this resource

### Debug Information

- Check server console for framework detection messages
- Use `/evidence_status` for comprehensive system status
- Verify all coordinates use `vector4` format with headings

## üìù Recent Code Improvements

### Cleanup and Optimization

- **Removed Test Commands**: All test/debug commands removed for production use
- **Code Cleanup**: Eliminated redundant variables and unused functions
- **Performance Optimization**: Streamlined convoy movement and AI systems
- **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive documentation reflecting current codebase

### Best Practices Implementation

- **FiveM Standards**: Adherence to FiveM best practices for entity creation and management
- **Framework Integration**: Proper framework detection and integration methods
- **Thread Management**: Efficient thread creation and management
- **Event Handling**: Robust event handling with proper validation

---

**Note**: This resource has been optimized for production use with all test commands and debug code removed. The codebase follows FiveM and framework best practices for maximum stability and performance.
