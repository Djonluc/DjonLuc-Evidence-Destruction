# üöì Evidence Destruction Event ‚Äì Complete Build Documentation

## Overview

The **Evidence Destruction Event** is a dynamic FiveM script that spawns a **high-security motorcade** transporting confiscated items (weapons, drugs, cash, or other server-configured items) to a secure destruction site.

**Job Restrictions:**

- **Event Start:** Only DOJ members or players with job type `leo` can start the event.
- **Guard AI:** Escort peds will **not attack** anyone with a police or LEO job.

Players outside these roles may attempt to intercept the convoy. If all escort peds are eliminated, a **loot crate** spawns at the rear of the escorted vehicle containing **randomized or configured items**.

---

## Features

- **Configurable Convoy Composition**

  - Armored cars, SUVs, motorcycles, and FBI/SWAT vehicles
  - Configurable ped types and escort numbers

- **Evidence Transport**

  - Items ‚Äúloaded‚Äù into convoy vehicles conceptually
  - Supports server inventory integration

- **Custom Routes & Destruction Locations**

  - Start location, waypoints, and destruction site
  - Multiple routes possible for unpredictability

- **Combat & Engagement AI**

  - Guard peds engage attacking players except DOJ/LEO jobs
  - Escort vehicles respond dynamically
  - Optional reinforcements or escalation

- **Loot Crate Mechanic**

  - Spawns at rear of escorted vehicle if all escort peds are killed
  - Contains random or configured items
  - Players can loot crate before event ends

- **Event Ending Conditions**

  - Event ends when convoy reaches destruction location
  - Loot crate does not spawn if convoy reaches destination intact

- **Job Restrictions**

  - Only DOJ/LEO jobs can trigger the event
  - Guard peds ignore players with police/LEO jobs

---

## Future Enhancements

- Night-only or dynamic random spawns
- Helicopters, SWAT trucks, HRT vehicles
- Interactive loot crates with alarms or timed unlock
- Event notifications to alert players: ‚ÄúConvoy spotted near X location‚Äù
- Dynamic difficulty scaling with more vehicles/peds for high-level players
