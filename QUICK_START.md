/createroute myroute        # Start creating a route
/setstart                   # Set start point (where you are)
/setend                     # Set end point (where you are)
/useroute myroute           # Use your created route
```

### Method 4: Manual Setup (Advanced)

```bash
# Console commands (admin only)
setspawn 402.76 -1019.04 29.33 355.06

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No permission"**: Check your job with `/checkjob`
2. **Convoy not moving**: Verify route is set with `/route`
3. **Peds not spawning**: Check console for error messages
4. **Vehicles not appearing**: Verify coordinates and vehicle models

### Getting Help

- **Console Commands**: Use `/evidence_status` for system info
- **Route Issues**: Check route with `/route` or `/convoyroute`
- **Job Problems**: Verify job with `/checkjob`
- **Framework Issues**: Check server console for detection messages
